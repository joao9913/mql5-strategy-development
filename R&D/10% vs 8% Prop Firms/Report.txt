- Question/Problem
	What is the actual impact of having 10% vs 8% targets on phase 1, on prop-firm challenges using normal trading strategies with constant risk management.

- Methodology
	- Use prop firm simulations 
	- Risk 2% per trade
	- Use 3 strategies to have more sample
	- Compare metrics regarding winrate, durations, and other important metrics.
	
	
- Data Analysis
	Using 3 strategies, merged metrics:
	- 10%
		- Winrate				- 65%
		- Average Days		-  26
		- Avg Cons Wins		- 2.58
	- 8%
		- Winrate				- 69%
		- Average Days		-  20
		- Avg Cons Wins		- 2.98


- Conclusions
	- It takes 6 more days to pass a Phase 1 if the target is 10%, rather than 8%. Simply, the effect of adding 2 aditionally percentage is not that
	  noticeable in the long term. Results were as expected. FTMO can still be used.
