- Question/Problem
	Compare if random probability strategies still make any money when trading with prop-firms. Aditionally, check if EDGE has a big impact on these types of systems.
	
- Methodology
	- Create 15 random probability strategies
	- Run normal simulations using 2% fixed risk per trade
	- Run EDGE simulations on the same dataset
	- Join metrics and compare these
