- Question/Problem
	Study if the EDGE Risk Scaling plan has a big advantage over using a standard fixed risk percentage. 
	Compare the advantage of the edge system always ending up in profit after a loss, while normal risk percentage doesn't 
	end up in profit but more tries further down the challenge.
		
- Methodology
	- Test multiple fixed risk percentages in 3 normal trading strategies (1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%)
	- Compare metrics regarding profitability, duration, testing both challenges, and funded simulations.

- Conclusions
	- 1.5% vs EDGE	
		- 4% more probability of having a payout 
		- 2 more payouts in average 
		- 0.2% more profit per payout
		- 0.2% more monthly winrate
		- 0.2% less monthly profit
		
	- 1.75% vs EDGE	
		- 1% less probability of having a payout 
		- 1 more payouts in average 
		- 0.8% more profit per payout
		- 0.4% less monthly winrate
		- 1% more monthly profit
	
	- 2.0% vs EDGE
		- 6% less probability of having a payout
		- 1.2 less payouts in average
		- 1.6% more profit per payout
		- 7.55 less monthly winrate
		- 2.2% more monthly profit
		
	- More testing is needed regarding payout taking using normal simulations, due to the fact that the normal simulation does not
	stop after a certain profit threshold, and goes on until 14 days have passed. 
		Also, it seems that using EDGE to pass challenge phases is a bit more effective regarding duration and winrate, although the 
	difference is not that noticeable. 
		The final answer will only be possible after testing these two methods of risk scaling with random strategies, to ensure that random 
	probability strategies would still make money using prop-firm trading.
