# TradingAutomatedProjects

This repository contains my automated trading projects for MetaTrader5 (MQL5).
It includes strategy development, testing, and utility classes. I will also include
the full project of my PUSH risk management system, later.

## Structure

- **Experts/VantedgeTrading** → Expert Advisors (.mq5 files)
- **Include/VantedgeTrading** → Shared classes and functions (.mqh files)

## Future Plans

- Finish coding the OOP version of the strategies and GITHUB implementation of the workspace.
- Developed, optimize and test more "simple" strategies to use in the PUSH method.
