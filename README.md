# MQL5 Repository

## Overview

This repository contains all MetaTrader 5 development work, including Expert Advisors, include files, presets, and optimization data for trading systems developed under Vantedge Trading.

The goal is to maintain a complete version-controlled record of all active and experimental projects, with clear separation between strategies, risk management systems, and shared code modules.

## TODO
  ### Simulations
    Implement single phase and full challenge testing (P1, P2, P3, P1+P2, P1+P2+P3)
    Implement full challenge report (instead of per phase outcome)
    Implement metrics calculated from the reports    

## How To Use

    Clone this repository into your MetaTrader 5 MQL5 directory.
    Ensure your .gitignore excludes unnecessary MT5 folders (Tester, Logs, etc.).
    Update and commit changes only to:
    /Experts/Vantedge/
    /Include/Vantedge/
    /Presets/
    /Optimizations/
    Push to GitHub regularly to keep version history synced
